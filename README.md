Run MongoDB with: `docker-componse up -d` this will start the latest version of MongoDB after downloading the image.

Shutdown with `docker-compose stop` to only stop the containers or `docker-compose down` to terminate all containers after stopping.

Logging into MongoDB after starting by using `mongo admin -u root -p rootpassword`. This will start the Mongo shell and logs you in.
